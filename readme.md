# Data Structures using C++

This repository contains the implementation part of many applied **data structures** using **C++** programming language.
Follow the steps to compile and run the **.cpp** files.
1. open terminal and browse to the directory containing the **cpp** file.
2. type command **g\+\+ \<output_file_name\> \<all_source_files>\**
3. type command **\.\/\<output_file_name\>**

Further implementations of data structures will be added.
**Feel free to try out the implementations in other languages as well**
